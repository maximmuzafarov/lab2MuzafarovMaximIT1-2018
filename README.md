First of all I created a new java web project in NetBeans. In the index.html file I have written the code to render my calculator. I added two lines with numbers, a menu for selecting functions such as Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division and Exponent, and two buttons such as calculate and reset. Next, I created a Java servlet CalcServ where I implemented these functions. I registered each line when displaying the result of the operation and its calculation. After I was done, I connected the CalcServ servlet to the index.html file, then right-clicked on the project, did a Clean and build, and ran the project.
